This code was developed during my graduate program, while taking a class on C++ in the CS department. This was a group project that was completed with two other naval architecture classmates of mine. We chose to develop a genetic algorithm that would optimize the main dimensions of a hullform based on established resistance prediction methods for Series 64 hulls. The code additionally outputs a text file of the population at each iteration, allowing data visualization post-processing if desired.

Working within the constraints of the resistance prediction method, we are able to get reasonable results from the program. Keep in mind that this is only minimizing the required power given the vessel dimensions with imposed constraints on the block coefficient, L/B, B/T ratios etc. This is not optimizing hull lines, only dimensions of the Series 64 hullform.
